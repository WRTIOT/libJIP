/** \mainpage libJIP Documentation
 *
 *  \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 *  libJIP provides a C API for accessing the JIP service of JenNet-IP wireless nodes
 *  in a IEEE802.15.4 network.
 *  JIP is a UDP protocol on IPv6. IPv6 is used due to the huge address space that is
 *  available for the wireless nodes.
 *  JIP is a self-describing protocol, supporting automatic discovery both of the nodes
 *  that exist in a network, and of the services that they support, via their MiBs and Variables.
 *
 *  \section usage_sec Usage
 * 
 *  This section shows the stages necessary to discover a JIP network of nodes, read every 
 *  variable in the network and then print the results.
 *
 *  \subsection step1 Step 1: Initialise libJIP and JIP context
 *  \code
    tsJIP_Context sJIP_Context;
    if (eJIP_Init(&sJIP_Context) != E_JIP_OK)
    {
        printf("JIP startup failed\n");
        exit (-1);
    }
    \endcode
 * 
 *  \subsection step2 Step 2: Connect to IPv6 address of network gateway.
 *  \code
    if (eJIP_Connect(&sJIP_Context, pcBorderRouterIPv6Address, JIP_DEFAULT_PORT) != E_JIP_OK)
    {
        printf("JIP connect failed\n");
        exit (-1);
    }
    \endcode
 *
 *  \subsection step3 Step 3: Discover network contents.
 *  \code
    if (eJIP_DiscoverNetwork(&sJIP_Context) != E_JIP_OK)
    {
        printf("JIP discover network failed\n");
        exit (-1);
    }
    \endcode
 *
 * \subsection step4 Step 4: Iterate accross the nodes in the network.
 * First the network context must be locked to prevent any other thread modifying it.
 *  \code
    tsNode *psNode;
    tsJIPAddress   *NodeAddressList = NULL;
    uint32_t        u32NumNodes = 0;
    
    printf("Reading Network: \n");
    
    if (eJIP_GetNodeAddressList(&sJIP_Context, &NodeAddressList, &u32NumNodes) != E_JIP_OK)
    {
        printf("Error reading node list\n");
        exit(0);
    }
    
    for (NodeIndex = 0; NodeIndex < u32NumNodes; NodeIndex++)
    {
        char buffer[INET6_ADDRSTRLEN] = "Could not determine address\n";
        
        psNode = psJIP_LookupNode(&sJIP_Context, &NodeAddressList[NodeIndex]);
        if (!psNode)
        {
            printf("Node has been removed\n");
            continue;
        }
        
        inet_ntop(AF_INET6, &psNode->sNode_Address.sin6_addr, addr_buffer, INET6_ADDRSTRLEN);
        
        printf("  Reading Node: %s", addr_buffer);
        
        ...
        
        eJIP_UnlockNode(psNode);
    }
    free(NodeAddressList);
    \endcode
 *
 * \subsection step5 Step 5: Iterate accross the MiBs of the node
 *  \code
        tsMib *psMib;

        psMib = psNode->psMibs;
        while (psMib)
        {
            printf("    Reading Mib: %s\n", psMib->pcName);
            ...
            psMib = psMib->psNext;
        }
    \endcode
 *
 * \subsection step6 Step 6: Iterate accross the variables of the MiB
 *  \code
                psVar = psMib->psVars;
                while (psVar)
                {
                    printf("      Reading Var: %s\n", psVar->pcName);
                    ...
                    psVar = psVar->psNext;
                }
    \endcode
 *
 * \subsection step7 Step 7: Read the variable
 *  \code
                    if (eJIP_GetVar(&sJIP_Context, psVar) != E_JIP_OK)
                    {
                        printf("      Error reading Var: %s\n", psVar->pcName);
                    }
    \endcode
 *
 * \subsection step8 Step 8: Print the network context.
 *  \code
    if (eJIP_PrintNetworkContent(&sJIP_Context) != E_JIP_OK)
    {
        printf("Error displaying network contents.\n");
    }
    \endcode
